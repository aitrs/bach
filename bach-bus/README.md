# bach-bus
Under construction. I will be looking for contributors but for now I'm building the bases.
I will be looking for contributors afterwards and will write contributing guidelines but
for now the only thing you need to know is that this repo is a submodule of this project
https://github.com/aitrs/bach . This project is basically a modular backup manager.
